# Environment Variables

Environment variables from bash are available in JavaScript via the `$.env` object.

When starting the script any environment variable that starts with an upper case ascii letter is copied to the `$.env` object. This object is updated after every bash command so you do not have to manually sync the environment.

    var home = $.env.HOME;

Any environment variable that does not start with an upper case ascii character can be fetched with the `$.getEnv()` method.

    var lastSetVar = $.getEnv("_");

Variables can be added or changed in the bash environment with `$.setEnv(name, value);`

    var i = 0;
    for ( ; i < 10 ; i++) {
        $.setEnv("i", i);
        echo "Number${i}"
    }

Some variables are automatically synced from JavaScript to bash, there is a list of Strings in the `$.watch` array that defines which global vars ar copied to Bash before executing a command.  This list can be manipulated.

    $.watch.push("myVar");

By default it contains `["gi", "gj", "gk"]` so that simple for loop variables are propagated to Bash.

    for (gi = 0 ; gi < 10 ; gi++ ){
      wget -O - http://linux.com/linux-cd-${gi}.iso.tar.gz | tar x
    }

It can be removed if you dont want any variables copied to the Bash environment.

Passing variables to bash via the `$.watch` list only works for variable declared int ehglobal scope.

All UPPER_CASE JavaScript variables in the global scope are copied to the bash environment by default. This is controlled by the `$.watchUpper` boolean flag.

	$.watchUpper = true;
	
The variable can be set to false to prevent copying global variables from JavaScript to bash.

It is recommeded to declare global variables that you wish to be available in bash at the start of the script, for example

    var MY_FILE_NAME = null;

This makes it clear that the variable is in the global scope.
