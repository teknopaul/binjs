# Magic Vars

/bin/js sets some variable in the global scope at startup that developers should be aware of since they are useful.

## Script Arguments `argc, argv`

The values `argc` (an Integer) and `argv` (an Array) are set when the script runs with the count of arguments to the script and the arguments as a JavaScript Array of Strings.  The first element in the array is the name of the script.

This is the JavaScript equivalent of Bash's `$#`, `$0`, `$@` and `$*`.

## Last command exit value `errono`

In a similar style to C code the global var `errno` is set to the exit value of the last command executed by Bash.

    ./myScript.sh
    switch(errno) {
      case 0 :
        ...

This is the JavaScript equivalent of Bash's `$?`.


## Global Magic Vars `gi, gj, gk`

The vars `gi,gj,gk` are predefined in the global scope and are synchronized with the Bash environment with every call.

    for (gi = 0 ; gi < 5 ; gi++) {
        echo gi is $gi
    }

This is a simple convenience but when copying code be aware that only `gi,gj` and `gk` work like this, and only in the global scope.

    for (gx = 0 ; gx < 5 ; gx++) {
        echo gx is $gx   # this will NOT work
    }

Overloading the global vars is possilbe by mistake, this will cause confusion, since the global `gi` is overriden by a local variable, but the global var is passed to the Bash environment.

    var gi = 0;     
    echo gi is $gi  # Wrong 
    
## Process ID `pid`

The global var `pid` is set, this is the JavaScript equivalent of Bash's `$$`.

    new File("/var/run/myapp.pid").write("" + pid);

## Last executed process ID `lastpid`

The global var `lastpid` is set when Bash forks a process.

    ./longRunningScript.sh &
    $.println("Forked:" + lastpid);

This is the JavaScript equivalent of Bash's `$!`.
